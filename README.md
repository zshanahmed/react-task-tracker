# Task Tracker

A single-page react application that lets users add task/ delete task/ toggle reminder for tasks. 

This React Application is just a practice project that helped learning few things as follows:
* Using components to reuse different elements on the page
* Use state to pass through components and do changes correspondingly
* How styling works in JS and how we can do inline stylings
* How props work and how we can ensure proptypes as well as default props
* How forms work and states can help with form inputs
* How json-server works and how backend can be connected with front-end for Adding/Deleting/Updating tasks
